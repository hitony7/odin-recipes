                Melon Pan is sweet bread covered in a thin layer of crisp biscuit/cookie crust with grid line pattern on top. The Japanese word for bread is “pan (パン)”, which came from the Portuguese word for bread. Now why is it called “melon“?
                Does it taste like melon? No, traditionally the bread does NOT include melon flavor or the fruit itself. Then why is it called Melon Pan if there is no melon flavor?
                There are a few different theories for the origin of Melon Pan’s name (still no conclusive theory even today).
                Some say that the original melon pan was invented during the Meiji Era. The bread resembled an oriental melon (マクワウリ) with the parallel lines on the crust, and was filled with sweet white bean paste (shiro-an) inside. During that time, the oriental melon was sold as “melon” so they started to call this “Melon Pan”.

                        Make a well in the centre of the flour and add the liquid mixture and stir to form a soft dough.
                        Transfer to an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead for about 10 min or until smooth and elastic.
                        With the mixer motor running, add the chopped butter until the butter is combined and a smooth and silky dough forms (about a further 10 minutes).

                        Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover and set aside in a warm place to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
                        Divide the bread dough into 8 equal sized balls and knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
                        Roll out the refrigerated cookie dough on cling wrap to 5mm thick.

                        Once it is rolled place one bread dough on top of one cookie dough ball and wrap together using cling wrap.
                        Take the cling wrap off and score the cookie dough surface diagonally and sprinkle the granule sugar.
                        Repeat for all 8 bread rolls.
                        Place them on a cooking paper lined oven tray and cover with clean damp cloth and set aside for about 40 min or until doubled in size.
